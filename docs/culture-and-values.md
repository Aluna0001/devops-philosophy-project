# Team Culture and Values

## Core Values

### Responsibility
We take ownership of both individual and collective goals. This includes responsibility for our own learning, our teammates' understanding, and the overall success of our deliverables.

### Trust
We believe in each other's intentions and competencies. We trust that every team member acts in the best interest of both the team and the project, and we have confidence in each other's ability to handle responsibility.

### Curiosity
We consistently seek to understand not just what was done, but why it was done. We maintain an inquisitive mindset about our work, our processes, and our learning.

## Team Rituals

### Why Ritual
During work presentations, each team member must ask at least one "why" question to ensure shared understanding of decisions and implementations.

### Daily Check-in Ritual
At each meeting, team members share their energy/capacity level on a scale of 1-10, enabling better task distribution and mutual support.
